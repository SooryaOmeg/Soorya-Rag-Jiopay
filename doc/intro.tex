\section{Introduction}
In recent years, conversational AI has transformed customer support by providing instant, accurate, and scalable responses. Traditional chatbots often rely on predefined rules or static FAQs, limiting their ability to handle complex or unforeseen queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by combining information retrieval with large language models (LLMs), enabling the generation of contextually accurate and citation-backed answers.

This project focuses on building a production-grade RAG chatbot for JioPay, leveraging publicly accessible business and help center data. The system not only retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base but also generates natural language responses while providing transparent citations. Through ablation studies on chunking strategies, embeddings, and ingestion pipelines, this work explores the optimal configurations for performance, accuracy, and efficiency, culminating in a deployable web application accessible via a public URL.
