The refund amount is handled in the following ways:\n\n1.  **Refund Deduction:** The refund amount will be deducted from any pending settlements in your JioPay account. This means the money will be taken from funds that are already scheduled to be paid out to you.\n\n2.  **Settlement Availability:** If there are no pending settlements available to cover the refund, the refund will be placed on hold. The refund will be processed when a new payment is received from another customer for an amount equal to or greater than the refund amount.
