Therefore, the complaints would \nno longer be rejected simply on account of “not covered under the \ngrounds listed in the scheme”.​\n​\n  \n3.​ The Scheme has done away with the jurisdiction of each ombudsman office.​\n​\n \n4.​ A Centralised Receipt and Processing Centre has been set up at RBI, \nChandigarh for receipt and initial processing of physical and email complaints \nin any language.​\n​\n \n5.​ The responsibility of representing the Regulated Entity and furnishing \ninformation in respect of complaints filed by customers against the Regulated \nEntity would be that of the Principal Nodal Officer in the rank of a General \nManager in a Public Sector Bank or equivalent.​\n​\n \n6.​ The Regulated Entity will not have the right to appeal in cases where an \nAward is issued by the ombudsman against it for not furnishing satisfactory \nand timely information/documents."
